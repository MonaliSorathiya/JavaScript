# JavaScript in the Browser DOM Manipulation and Events

Here in this we use JavaScript in the browser for the very first time.
And so we're gonna code up this really cool DICE game where we make JavaScript actually interact with an HTML webpage.

## GAME RULES : 
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
